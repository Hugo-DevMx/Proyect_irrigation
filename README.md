# Irrigation

This project is thought to reduce the waste of water at the time of watering any green area, of which this idea was thought as a team outside the institution of which we studied, therefore this idea is only ours and nobody else's.

This project will have a mobile app made with the framwork flutter and the dart language as well as the circuit to manage the sprinklers, sensors and other components.
